Stands for Evans Data Corp. I was assigned to create a new feature for their website to boost one of their websites more traffic.

### Description

I was given a task by Evans Data Corp to create a feature called "Code of the Day", a user-based daily coding challenge. Users must be logged in and register in order to participate.

Users can:
* Submit their answer to the current coding challenge of the day (created by other registered users)
* Submit their own code for others to solve
* Comment on other submissions (can only be seen if they participated)
* Rate other users' answers and codes

### Softwares/Websites Used

* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - Text Editor where project was written, debugged and managed in.
* [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) - Used to utilize and display server-side language onto my local machine
* [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) - MySQL Database management and storage

### Estimated Time

Total time: 3 weeks

The Project is live and complete! You can view it [here!](https://www.devmetric.com/#code-of-the-week)
